## [Stone Game](https://codeforces.com/contest/1538/problem/A)

To begin with, it is important for us to find the positions of the maximum and minimum element, for this we traverse the array and write the positions of these elements.

    int min = 0;  
    int max = 0;  
      
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {  
        if (array[max] < array[i]) max = i;  
        if (array[min] > array[i]) min = i;  
    }

Since, according to the conditions of the problem, it is not so important for us whether we first delete the maximum element, and then the maximum one, or vice versa, it is recommended, for convenience, to bring the positions of the maximum and minimum element to the leftmost element or the rightmost element.

    int l = min(max, min);  
    int r = max(max, min);

Next, you should consider the cases that may be present in the task:

 - **Located at the edges.** One of the elements is on the left and the other on the right, and they are far from each other. For example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. 

In this situation, add up the index of the left element (do not forget to add one, since the index starts from zero) and the length of the array minus the index of the right element (there is no need to add one here).

    int leftRightWay = (l + 1) + (array.length - r);

*P.S. Since we operate not with the positions of the maximum and minimum element, but with the positions of the leftmost and rightmost element, it does not matter for us whether the maximum element is on the left (and the minimum on the right) or vice versa.*

 - **Both are at the left edge.** Both elements are to the left edge and not far from each other. For example: `[1, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

In this situation, we just take the index of the right element (adding 1, since this is the index that starts at zero).

    int leftWay = r + 1;

- **Both are at the right edge.**  Both elements are to the right edge and not far from each other. For example: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 9]`

We subtract the index of the left element from the length of the array, in fact, we get how many elements are from the edge of the array to the left element.

    int rightWay = array.length - l;

Finally, we will find the minimum value of the three calculated options:

    return min(leftRightWay, min(leftWay, rightWay));

Complexity: O(n)

## [Friends and Candies](https://codeforces.com/contest/1538/problem/B)

Since we need to make sure that all friends have the same number of candies, we need to find the median (arithmetic mean) of all candies.

    double median = Arrays.stream(array).average().orElseThrow();
    
Further, it is logical to assume that if the median value is not a positive integer number, then we will not be able to solve the problem (we cannot crush candies, which means that someone will obviously get more candies). This is the only situation in which we cannot solve the problem, which means that we output `-1` in the answer (by condition)

    if (Math.ceil(median) != median) {  
        return -1;  
    }

Logically, we cannot take sweets from those who have them and there is less than the average value (we strive to ensure that the number of sweets is the same for everyone, which means this value is the median). Therefore, we select only those people who have more than the median number of candies.

    int counter = 0;  
    for (int n : array) {  
        if (n > median)  
            counter++;  
    }  
      
    return counter;

Complexity: O(2n) â‰ˆ O(n)
